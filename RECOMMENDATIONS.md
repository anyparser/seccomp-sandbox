# Security Recommendations

## Critical Security Considerations for Universal Command Execution

1. **Path Validation**
   - Consider implementing a whitelist of allowed executable paths
   - Validate absolute paths to prevent path traversal attacks
   - Consider implementing hash verification of allowed executables

2. **Command Injection Prevention**
   - Validate and sanitize all command arguments
   - Consider implementing argument pattern matching
   - Implement strict argument length limits

3. **Additional Security Measures**
   - Consider implementing executable signature verification
   - Add capability to restrict specific executables
   - Consider implementing a configuration file for allowed executables

4. **Monitoring and Auditing**
   - Log all executed commands with full paths
   - Implement command execution quotas
   - Consider adding real-time alerts for suspicious patterns

5. **Configuration Recommendations**
   - Create separate configurations for different types of executables
   - Implement different security profiles based on executable type
   - Consider maintaining a database of known-safe executables

Please review these recommendations carefully before deploying the seccomp sandbox in production.
